          The book blogging world is one of the oldest and bustling, close-knit
          communities, way before Bookstagram (Bookish community on Instagram),
          Book Twitter, Booktube (Bookish community on Youtube) and other social
          media communities gained prominence. Book blogs are old souls. They
          save you with short recommendations and long essays, rambling posts
          and pictures of lovely stacks on the nightstand. In the present times,
          the walls of book blogging have expanded to accommodate literary
          travel, literary lifestyle, bookish hygge and cosy reading nights. It
          is difficult to choose a few blogs for a list because there are so
          many wonderful ones, and of course many more that I myself visit
          often. Here are some stylish book blogs that are aesthetically
          pleasing, have clean and thoughtful designs, and post great content
          including book recommendations, literary travel and more. Be it honest
          book talk or drop-dead gorgeous book photography or easy navigation,
          these definitely spark joy. You will find some of the best book blogs
          that’ll help you decide whether a new book is for you, blogs that talk
          about monetizing blogging and those that help you do some armchair
          travelling with a book.

          Book Blogging is emerging as a very popular hobby among Indian youths
          in recent years. If I am not extending the argument beyond its
          stretching levels, then let me say it openly that Indian book market
          is the largest book market in the world and the ones who influence the
          buying choices of readers are also the ones who are mostly sought by
          the authors to help them with their books popularity, sales and
          recognition. Do you agree with me here? In short, book bloggers in
          India are the people who can become very important in the years to
          come when it comes to having an impact on the direction of the book
          market, probability of a title becoming the bestseller and the chances
          of an author becoming overnight fame. So, without doing much ado, here
          I am with a curated list of top 10 book bloggers in India in the year
          2020. We are already mid-way into the year affected highly by
          coronavirus but the bloggers are still doing their job as usual –
          nothing can deter them from their mission to read and review the
          books.
